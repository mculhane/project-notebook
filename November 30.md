# Design notebook for week ending November 30, 2014

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

* 45 minutes
  * Critiqued Ellen's project
  * The critique was completed on time, but submitted a few hours late (as I was still waiting for access to Ellen's GitHub repo).
